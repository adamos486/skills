## Examples

### Good Example
"You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You'll get the chance to put the knife in" 
- Pink Floyd, "Dogs"

These lyrics from Pink Floyd demonstrate the poetic, metaphorical nature of effective songwriting. The vivid imagery and clever use of irony create a compelling narrative.

"Sam Stone was alone 
When he popped his last balloon
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair
Well, he played his last request
While the room smelled just like death
With an overdose hovering in the air"
- John Prine, "Sam Stone"

The lyrics from "Sam Stone" by John Prine showcase powerful storytelling, painting a vivid picture with carefully chosen words and details.

### Bad Example
"I put molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it. 
I went home and enjoyed that, she ain't even know it"
- Rick Ross

These lyrics demonstrate unethical, misogynistic content that should be avoided in songwriting.

"You're so ganster, I'm so thug
Oh, I swear to you, I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy, looking for a two-ply Hefty bag
To hold my love"
- Train, "Hey Soul Sister"

The lyrics from Train's "Hey Soul Sister" show cringeworthy, nonsensical writing that fails to connect with the listener.
